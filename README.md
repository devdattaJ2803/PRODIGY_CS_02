# Image Encryption Tool with GUI

This repository contains a simple image encryption tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) as part of my Cyber Security Internship. The tool uses pixel manipulation to encrypt and decrypt images.

## Contents

- `image_encryption.py`: A Python script that provides a GUI for encrypting and decrypting images using pixel manipulation.
- `README.md`: Documentation and details about the project.

## Features

- **Image Encryption**: Encrypts an image by applying a key-based transformation to each pixel value.
- **Image Decryption**: Decrypts an image by reversing the key-based transformation.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly GUI for selecting images, specifying the key, and viewing results.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Execute the `image_encryption_gui.py` script to launch the GUI application:
     ```bash
     python image_encryption_gui.py
     ```

2. **Interact with the GUI**:
   - Click "Load Image" to select an image file.
   - Enter a key in the "Encryption/Decryption Key" field.
   - Click "Encrypt Image" or "Decrypt Image" to perform the respective operation and save the result.

## Learning Outcomes

- Implemented image encryption and decryption using pixel manipulation in Python.
- Created a GUI application using `tkinter`.
- Practiced using command-line arguments for Python scripts.
